# Contributing

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to this project.

The process is straight-forward.

 - Read [How to get faster PR reviews](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#best-practices-for-faster-reviews) by Kubernetes (but skip step 0 and 1)
 - Fork the [git repository](https://github.com/dahlb/carrier_api).
   - Add a new method try to keep its signature as similar to other region/brands as possible.
   - Add or update deterministic pytest coverage and fixture data.
   - Run `scripts/live_smoke_test` against a live Carrier account when practical.
   - Update `src/carrier_api/live_smoke_test.py` only when the default smoke-test flow should cover a new reusable live API path.
   - Keep one-off local probe edits out of the final PR, and turn useful live output into stored fixtures or pytest coverage.
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**main**](https://github.com/dahlb/carrier_api/tree/main) branch.
