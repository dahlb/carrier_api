Api Wrapper for Carrier Infinity API using async in python, this was inspired by [this guide](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api_lib_index) to be a lightweight wrapper, with simple error handling.

a lot of this is based on [homebridge-carrier-infinity](https://github.com/grivkees/homebridge-carrier-infinity).
